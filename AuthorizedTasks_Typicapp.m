/*
 The kCommandSpecs array is used by both the app and the helper tool to define
 the set of supported commands to the BetterAuthorizationSampleLib module.
 
 The kCommandProcs array is used by the helper tool only.
 
 It is important that the two arrays kCommandSpecs and kCommandProcs
 have the same number of elements and that corresponding elements refer to the same tasks.
